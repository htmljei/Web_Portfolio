            <h2 id="childhood">Childhood Years</h2>
            <p>
                <sup>1</sup> I was born and raised in Quezon City, a city with a peaceful yet simple lifestyle. 
                <sup>2</sup> My family lived in a small but cozy home in a quiet neighborhood. 
                <sup>3</sup> My parents always encouraged me to focus on my studies. 
                <sup>4</sup> I attended a public school within walking distance from our house.
                <sup>5</sup> Every morning, I woke up early and followed my usual routine. 
                <sup>6</sup> During recess, I loved playing tag and hide and seek with my classmates. 
                <sup>7</sup> Watching cartoons and anime made my afternoons exciting.
                <sup>8</sup> My mom often asked me to help with household chores. 
                <sup>9</sup> Our family outings were usually to malls or parks on weekends.
                <sup>10</sup> I was not very social and had only a few friends.
                <sup>11</sup> I preferred staying at home playing video games or watching movies.
                <sup>12</sup> The streets of Quezon City were always busy.
                <sup>13</sup> My parents were strict, and I had to ask for permission to go outside.
                <sup>14</sup> I wasn’t involved in any extracurricular activities.
                <sup>15</sup> My childhood was simple, but I was content.
                <sup>16</sup> I always obeyed my parents and focused on my studies.
                <sup>17</sup> I never excelled in sports, but I enjoyed school.
                <sup>18</sup> Looking back, my childhood was peaceful and filled with happy moments.
                <sup>19</sup> Though ordinary, I appreciate my past experiences.
                <sup>20</sup> I realize now that simplicity made my childhood special.

            <h2 id="teenage">Teenage Years</h2>
            <p>
                <sup>1</sup> As a teenager, I was just an ordinary student. 
                <sup>2</sup> I was not the best in my class, but I managed to pass all my subjects. 
                <sup>3</sup> In senior high school, I chose ICT as my track because of my interest in computers.
                <sup>4</sup> Coding was initially difficult for me.
                <sup>5</sup> I often got distracted and spent more time playing games.
                <sup>6</sup> My father reminded me to focus, but I still stayed up late.
                <sup>7</sup> Sometimes, my friends and I studied together at coffee shops.
                <sup>8</sup> I was not active in school clubs or organizations.
                <sup>9</sup> I preferred spending my free time with friends rather than joining school events.
                <sup>10</sup> Street food such as fish balls and kwek-kwek became our favorites.
                <sup>11</sup> We enjoyed hanging out at malls during weekends.
                <sup>12</sup> My parents didn’t always allow me to go out.
                <sup>13</sup> Sometimes, I had to make excuses just to meet friends.
                <sup>14</sup> I managed to improve my grades before graduating.
                <sup>15</sup> Graduation day was a proud moment for my parents and me.
                <sup>16</sup> It felt rewarding to see their happy faces.
                <sup>17</sup> Senior high school passed by quickly.
                <sup>18</sup> Soon, I was preparing for my college journey.
                <sup>19</sup> I was nervous but also excited for the challenges ahead.
                <sup>20</sup> I promised myself that I would give my best in college.

            <h2 id="college">College Years</h2>
            <p>
                <sup>1</sup> Currently, I am a second-year BSIT student at University of the East. 
                <sup>2</sup> The first year was tough because everything was new to me. 
                <sup>3</sup> Learning programming languages was one of the biggest challenges.
                <sup>4</sup> Some subjects were difficult, but I put in extra effort.
                <sup>5</sup> Fortunately, I met great friends who helped me adjust.
                <sup>6</sup> We often studied together and worked on projects as a team.
                <sup>7</sup> After class, we enjoyed eating at small food stalls near the school.
                <sup>8</sup> Sometimes, we played online games to relieve stress.
                <sup>9</sup> College is definitely harder than high school.
                <sup>10</sup> I struggled with deadlines, exams, and challenging lessons.
                <sup>11</sup> However, I remind myself of why I chose this path.
                <sup>12</sup> I want to gain more technical knowledge and secure a good job.
                <sup>13</sup> Over time, I have learned better time management skills.
                <sup>14</sup> I still find some subjects difficult but continue to work hard.
                <sup>15</sup> Balancing study and social life is important.
                <sup>16</sup> On weekends, I go out with friends to relax.
                <sup>17</sup> College has been a tough but meaningful journey.
                <sup>18</sup> I believe that hard work will help me achieve my goals.
                <sup>19</sup> My dream is to work in the IT industry and support my family.
                <sup>20</sup> Although the road ahead is challenging, I am determined to succeed.
